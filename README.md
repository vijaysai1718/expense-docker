# Docker Best Practices

## 1. Use Official and Verified Images
- **Official Images:** Start with official images from Docker Hub when possible, as they are maintained and updated regularly.
- **Minimal Base Images:** Use minimal base images (like `alpine`) to reduce the attack surface and image size.

## 2. Keep Images Small
- **Multi-Stage Builds:** Use multi-stage builds to minimize the final image size by only including necessary components.
- **Remove Unnecessary Files:** Clean up package lists, cache files, and other unnecessary files to keep the image lean.

## 3. Tag Images Properly
- **Version Tagging:** Tag images with version numbers (e.g., `myapp:1.0`) instead of just using `latest` to avoid ambiguity and ensure consistency across deployments.

## 4. Run as Non-Root User
- **Non-Root User:** Create and run containers with a non-root user to improve security. You can add a user in the Dockerfile using `RUN useradd -m myuser` and switch to that user with `USER myuser`.

## 5. Optimize Layer Caching
- **Layer Order:** Order your Dockerfile instructions to maximize layer caching. Frequently changing commands should be at the end of the Dockerfile.
- **Combine Commands:** Combine commands where possible to reduce the number of layers, but balance it with readability.

## 6. Network Configuration
- **Custom Networks:** Use custom networks to isolate containers and manage communication more securely and efficiently.
- **Service Discovery:** Use Docker's built-in DNS service for container name resolution within custom networks.

## 7. Documentation and Comments
- **Document Dockerfiles:** Comment and document our Dockerfiles to explain the purpose of each instruction, making it easier for others to understand and maintain.

By following these best practices, we can ensure that our Docker containers are secure, efficient, and maintainable.
